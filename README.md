- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned a little more about how sizing images work, and how to position elements using flexbox.

I need to keep practicing to get a better understanding of sizing images responsively, and improve how I style elements for responsive pages.
